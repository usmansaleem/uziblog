		<p>
			I have redesigned this site from scratch. The header images are created using Gimp. The technologies stack used is
			Primefaces 3, JSF 2, EJB 3 and HSQLDB (developed on Eclipse). The site is deployed on Resin Caucho 4.0 which is open source and fully supports JEE 6 Web profile.

			The content was previously hosted on Nucleus CMS and after the crash of my last host, I decided that its time to switch to my own implementation
			of blogger software.
